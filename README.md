# Headline Sentiment and Source Analysis

## Description

This repository contains the code for an R Shiny app that displays:

1) Top news headlines based on user input, including a quantitative
sentiment analysis of the headline
2) News sources that produce top headlines

The Shiny app serves as a wrapper to the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
and [SENTIM-API](https://sentim-api.herokuapp.com). To use the app, 
users must register on the News API website to receive a free API
key.

Please access the published app at the following [link](https://rob-kravec.shinyapps.io/news).
